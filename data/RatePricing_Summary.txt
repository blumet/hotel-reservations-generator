Revenue Manager Summary — 2025-12-23

I updated rates based on current on-the-books occupancy (net of expected cancellations/no-shows), plus event-related compression and group displacement where applicable.

In total, 3,905 rate points changed: 0 increases and 0 decreases.

Over the next 14 days, the average pricing multiplier is 1.44. Rates were raised on higher-occupancy / higher-demand dates to protect ADR, and softened on lower-occupancy dates to stimulate pickup.
